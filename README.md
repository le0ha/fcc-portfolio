# freeCodeCamp Portfolio

Hey! ðŸ‘‹ This is where Iâ€™m documenting my learning journey through freeCodeCamp's curriculums.

Each folder represents a different curriculum or project area. I plan to complete multiple paths, including Full Stack Development and more.

## ðŸ“‚ Current contents

- `fullstack-curriculum` â€“ projects and exercises from the Full Stack Developer curriculum (HTML, CSS, accessibility, etc.)
- *(More folders will be added as I explore other curriculums)*

## âœ… Progress so far

- Completed: Basic HTML
- Completed: Semantic HTML
- Completed: Forms and Tables
- Completed: Accessibility
- Completed: Basic CSS
- Covered: Design, absolute/relative units, pseudo-classes/elements, colors, form styling

Iâ€™ll continue updating this repo with my progress, projects, and notes as I move forward.

Thanks for checking it out!
