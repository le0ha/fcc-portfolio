## Fullstack Curriculum

👋 Hey! This folder contains my work as I go through freeCodeCamp's **Full Stack Developer Curriculum**. Right now, I’ve completed the first part of the curriculum focused on **HTML** and started **CSS**.

## ✅ Topics I’ve covered so far:

- ✅ Basic HTML
- ✅ Semantic HTML
- ✅ HTML Forms and Tables
- ✅ Accessibility
- ✅ Basic CSS
- ✅ Design and Layout Concepts
- ✅ Absolute and Relative Units
- ✅ CSS Pseudo-Classes and Pseudo-Elements
- ✅ CSS Colors
- ✅ Styling Forms

## 📝 What’s inside:

- Labs and exercises from the HTML and CSS sections
- Mini-projects I completed to practice these concepts (e.g., sample forms, landing page mockups, styled tables)

## 🚧 Next steps:

I’ll continue adding new projects as I move into **Responsive Web Design**, **CSS Flexbox/Grid**, and later **JavaScript**.

Feel free to explore the folders and files — this repo is a work in progress as I build up my front-end development skills!
