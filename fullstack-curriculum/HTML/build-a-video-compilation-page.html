        <h1>My content creation career so far</h1>
        <p>During my childhood I was watching s lot of international content creators and at the age of 10 a dream of mine was to become an youtuber myself. I tried blogging, entertainment, sketches, gameplays and game reviews. The majority of the clips are lost, but some of them are still posted somewhere and I'm going to show them in this article, while improving my HTML skills.</p>

            <h2>First YouTube Channel</h2>
            <p>As the description says "Just playing and recording sometimes!". I was recording whatever I was playing at that moment, be it real life games or video games. I was editing on my phone because I didn't have a PC back in the days, but somehow i managed to break my all-time record of views on that channel, gathering 700+ views on one of my videos. But I don't like that video, so here's my favorite video on that channel where I complete football challenges with my friend.</p>

            <h2>Second Youtube Channel</h2>
            <p>This is my second channel, where I tried to do funny moments in games or just simple gameplay videos. Those types of videos where inspired by two youtubers I used to enjoy during that period, the most popular youtuber from my country, Marmok, and a youtuber that was doing videos about one of my favorite video games, WielinoXD. The following video is one of my favorites on that channel, being my first video edited on a computer aswell.</p>

            <h2>Third Youtube Channel</h2>
            <p>This is my third and currently the last YouTube channel I've created. I didn't have a specific topic in my head, just wanted to edit a video to see if I'd still get it, and to my surprise I did well. Here's the only video from that channel, a game review about 1v1.LOL.</p>
