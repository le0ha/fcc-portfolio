    <h1>Tortilla Omelette Recipe</h1>
    <p>Are you a student staying in a student dormitory and now you have to cook for yourself or just someone exploring new recipes? I know what it is like to be in your shoes (both casesðŸ˜‰), that's why I came up with an extremely <em>cheap and delicious breakfast</em> recipe that can save you tons of money and a lot of time in the morning. You won't need a lot of ingredients or "heavy artillery" so let's get to cooking.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Olive oil - 1 spoon</li>
      <li>Sausage - 50-100 grams</li>
      <li>Eggs - 3 pcs</li>
      <li>Cheese - 2-3 slices</li>
      <li>Tortilla - 1 wrap</li>
      <li>Chilli sauce - 1-2 spoons</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Get everything ready. Cut the sausage into small pieces, Slice the cheese and stir the eggs for 1-2 minutes.</li>
      <li>Heat up the pan, put one spoon of olive oil and the cut sausage into the pan.</li>
      <li>Fry the sausage for 2-3 minutes, afterwards pour the stirred eggs all over the pan.</li>
      <li>Wait until the omelette is almost ready (5-10 minutes) and put the tortilla wrap above the omelette.</li>
      <li>Wait for 20-30 seconds and flip the tortilla with the omelette (by now they must be stuck together so you should be able to do that).</li>
      <li>Put the sliced cheese on the tortilla omelette and fold it.</li>
      <li>Fry for 30 seconds more then flip the tortilla omelette again. You can turn off the stove now.</li>
      <li>Fry for more 30 seconds then take it out of the pan, unfold the tortilla omelette, spread the chilli sauce all over it and fold it back.</li>
      <li><em>VOILA!</em> Your meal is ready to be served.</li>
